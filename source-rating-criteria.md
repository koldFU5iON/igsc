# IGSC Source Rating Criteria
**Version:** 0.1 Draft
**Date:** December 2025

---

## Overview

In the IGSC bond-style rating system, **projects are rated, not studios**. Studios, publishers, and other entities are **sources** that contribute to a project's composite rating.

This document maps out how individual sources are rated independently, before combination into a final project rating.

---

## 1. Studio Source Rating

Studios are rated based on their **capacity to execute** a project, independent of external support.

### Rating Tiers

#### AAA Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 200+ dedicated staff
- **Infrastructure:** Multiple departments, established pipelines, proprietary tech/engines
- **Track record:** Multiple shipped AAA titles, proven at scale
- **Financial health:** Publicly traded OR owned by platform holder/major publisher
- **Geographic footprint:** Multiple offices, international presence

**Examples:**
- Ubisoft Montreal, EA DICE, Sony Santa Monica, Rockstar North

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Expanding (hiring wave, new studio openings, parent company investment)
- `-` = Contracting (layoffs, studio closures, restructuring)

---

#### AA Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 80-200 staff
- **Infrastructure:** Full departmental structure, established production processes
- **Track record:** Shipped multiple mid-to-large scope titles
- **Financial health:** Large independent with proven revenue OR wholly-owned subsidiary
- **Geographic footprint:** Single large office or 2-3 regional offices

**Examples:**
- Larian Studios (pre-BG3), IO Interactive, Paradox Development Studio

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Growing (recent hit, hiring, external validation)
- `-` = Challenges (project cancellations, funding concerns, key talent departures)

---

#### A Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 30-80 staff
- **Infrastructure:** Departmental structure emerging, formal processes
- **Track record:** 1-2 shipped commercial titles OR strong pedigree from AAA backgrounds
- **Financial health:** Independent with stable revenue OR investor-backed with runway
- **Geographic footprint:** Single office, potentially co-working space or hybrid

**Examples:**
- Many "AA game" developers, boutique studios spun out from AAA, successful indie scale-ups

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Scaling up (hiring, second project greenlit, series funding)
- `-` = Plateau (difficult to scale beyond current size, funding runway shortening)

---

#### BBB Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 15-30 staff
- **Infrastructure:** Small departments or functional roles, some formal processes
- **Track record:** First commercial title shipped OR experienced leads with unshipped project
- **Financial health:** Independent with grants/presales OR seed funding
- **Geographic footprint:** Single location, often shared space

**Examples:**
- Studios post-successful Kickstarter, grant recipients with commercial ambitions, second-time founders

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = External validation (grant awarded, publisher interest, festival selections)
- `-` = Funding uncertainty (runway <12 months, key staff part-time)

---

#### BB Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 10-15 staff (mix of full-time and contractors)
- **Infrastructure:** Ad-hoc processes, generalist roles
- **Track record:** No shipped commercial title OR single small release
- **Financial health:** Self-funded + small grants/presales
- **Geographic footprint:** Remote-first or single small office

**Examples:**
- First-time studios with experienced individuals, game jam winners scaling up

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Growing (converting contractors to full-time, grant applications advancing)
- `-` = Unstable (team members leaving, funding challenges)

---

#### B Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 5-10 people (mostly part-time or contractors)
- **Infrastructure:** Minimal formal process, founder-driven
- **Track record:** Hobbyist projects or unreleased work
- **Financial health:** Self-funded from personal savings, nights/weekends income
- **Geographic footprint:** Remote or home-based

**Examples:**
- Passion projects transitioning to commercial, experienced devs going indie

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Transitioning to full-time, community traction, crowdfunding success
- `-` = Losing momentum (members leaving, side-project status solidifying)

---

#### CCC/CC/C Studio
**Indicators:**
- **Team size:** 1-4 people
- **Infrastructure:** None, individual workflows
- **Track record:** No commercial releases, learning projects, game jams
- **Financial health:** Fully self-funded, part-time/hobbyist
- **Geographic footprint:** Home-based

**Examples:**

**Sub-tier distinctions:**
- **CCC:** 3-4 person team, part-time, first project
- **CC:** 2-person partnership, part-time
- **C:** Solo developer, part-time

**Modifier guidance:**
- `+` = Building momentum (Patreon/community support, going full-time soon)
- `-` = At risk of abandonment (activity slowing, life circumstances)

---

## 3. Other Potential Sources

Beyond studios and publishers, other sources may contribute to project ratings:

### Platform Holder Support
**Examples:** ID@Xbox dev kit grants, PlayStation Partners support, Epic MegaGrants
**Rating consideration:** Treated as supplementary funder source (typically BB-BBB range depending on scale)

### Regional/Government Grants
**Examples:** Film Victoria, Creative Europe, CMF (Canada), UK Games Fund
**Rating consideration:** BBB-A range depending on grant size and support services

### Community Funding
**Examples:** Kickstarter, Patreon, Fig
**Rating consideration:** Scaled based on amount raised + ongoing support (B-BBB typical)

### Technology Partners
**Examples:** Epic (Unreal), Unity, middleware providers offering licensing deals
**Rating consideration:** Modifier influence rather than direct rating (reduces costs, elevates production value)

## 4. Placeholder Theory: Combining Sources into Project Rating

**[DRAFT - Needs validation through real-world testing]**

### Approach 1: Weighted Average
```
Project Rating = (Studio Rating × Studio Weight) + (Publisher Rating × Publisher Weight) + (Other Sources × Weight)
```

**Example weights:**
- Studio: 50-60% (team capability is foundational)
- Publisher: 30-40% (resources and reach)
- Other sources: 10-20% (supplementary)

**Challenges:**
- How do we handle massive disparities? (C studio + AAA publisher)
- Does the publisher weight increase with their involvement level?

---

### Approach 2: Floor + Ceiling Model
```
Project Rating Floor = Studio Rating (can't go below team capability)
Project Rating Ceiling = Publisher Rating (can't exceed available resources)
Project Rating = Weighted point between floor and ceiling
```

**Example:**
- Studio: B (floor)
- Publisher: AA (ceiling)
- Project lands at A- (publisher elevates significantly but studio capacity limits ceiling)

**Challenges:**
- What happens when studio > publisher? (AAA studio self-publishing)
- How do we handle multiple sources?

---

### Approach 3: Additive Tier Model
```
Start with Studio Rating
Add tiers based on external support:
- Major publisher: +3-5 tiers
- Mid publisher: +2-3 tiers
- Small publisher: +1-2 tiers
```

**Example:**
- Studio: C (solo dev)
- Publisher: AAA (+4 tiers)
- Project: BBB-A range

**Challenges:**
- Less precise than weighted models
- Doesn't account for diminishing returns

---

### Approach 4: Bond-Inspired Composite Score
```
Calculate numerical scores for each source:
- AAA = 90-100
- AA = 80-89
- A = 70-79
- BBB = 60-69
- BB = 50-59
- B = 40-49
- CCC-C = 0-39

Weighted average, then map back to letter grade
```

**Example:**
- Studio: B (45 points) × 0.5 = 22.5
- Publisher: AA (85 points) × 0.5 = 42.5
- Total: 65 → **BBB rating**

**Challenges:**
- Feels arbitrary
- Loses intuitive meaning of tiers

---

## 5. Open Questions

1. **Should modifiers (+/-) carry through to project ratings?**
   - Studio: A-, Publisher: AA+ → Project: A? A+?

2. **How do we handle self-publishing?**
   - Is "no publisher" = neutral, or does it penalize the project rating?

3. **What about hybrid models?**
   - Publisher for some regions, self-pub in others
   - Multiple small funders vs. single large funder

4. **Does genre/scope matter?**
   - Should a narrative walking sim be graded differently than a AAA open-world?
   - Or is the rating purely about resources/structure regardless of output?

5. **How do we validate this model?**
   - Rate 50 real projects and see if industry stakeholders agree?
   - Test with publishers/investors to see if it's useful?
