## The Problem

The video game industry relies on informal labels — **Indie**, **AA**, **AAA** — to classify studios and projects. These terms are:

- **Inconsistent** — no universal agreement on definitions
- **Conflated** — mixing budget, team size, funding source, and creative independence into single labels
- **Unfair** — a solo developer and a 40-person funded studio both called "indie"
- **Static** — no mechanism to track studio growth over time

This creates unfair competition in awards, unclear eligibility for grants, and meaningless segmentation for the industry.

---

## The Solution: IGSC

The **International Game Studio Classification (IGSC)** provides a formal, multi-dimensional framework that classifies studios across clear, verifiable criteria.

### Key Features

- **Voluntary** — studios self-classify
- **Transparent** — criteria are public and consistent
- **Non-invasive** — no sensitive financial disclosure required
- **Lifecycle-aware** — studios can reclassify as they grow
- **Multi-dimensional** — separates team size, ownership, funding, and scope

### Classification Dimensions

**Structural (Production Context):**

| Dimension | Tiers |
|-----------|-------|
| Team Size | Micro (1–5) / Small (6–20) / Mid (21–80) / Large (80+) |
| Ownership | Independent / Affiliated / Owned |
| Funding Source | Self-funded / Grant / Publisher / Investor |
| Production Scope | Small / Medium / Large / Massive |

**Outcome (Success Metrics):**
- Revenue bands
- Player base metrics
- Critical reception
- Growth signals

### Example Classifications

| Studio Profile | IGSC Classification |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Solo developer, self-funded, small scope | Micro / Independent / Small |
| 15-person studio with publisher deal | Small / Affiliated / Medium |
| 50-person studio, investor-backed | Mid / Affiliated / Large |
| Platform-owned studio, 200+ team | Large / Owned / Massive |
