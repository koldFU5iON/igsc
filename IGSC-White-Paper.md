## Executive Summary

The video game industry relies on informal labels (Indie, AA, AAA) to classify studios and projects. These terms are culturally defined rather than structurally defined, leading to inconsistency, unfair competition, and a lack of transparency.

The **International Game Studio Classification (IGSC)** proposes a formal, multi-dimensional taxonomy that classifies studios based on clear, verifiable criteria across two axes: **Structural Context** (what resources a studio has) and **Outcome Metrics** (what results they achieve). The framework is:

- **Voluntary**: studios self-classify
- **Transparent**: criteria are public and consistent
- **Non-invasive**: no sensitive financial disclosure required
- **Lifecycle-aware**: studios can reclassify as they grow

This white paper outlines the problem, presents the framework, and invites adoption by platforms, awards bodies, publishers, and the broader industry.

## 1. Introduction

The video game industry has grown from a niche hobby into a global entertainment sector generating over $180 billion annually [CITATION NEEDED: recent Newzoo or similar market report, 2023-2024]. Yet despite this maturation, the industry lacks fundamental infrastructure that other creative sectors take for granted: a standardised way to classify and compare studios.

Film has its budget tiers and production categories. Music has major labels, independent labels, and self-released artists with clear distinctions. Publishing distinguishes between the Big Five, mid-size houses, and small presses. The game industry, by contrast, relies on vague, culturally-defined terms that emerged organically and have never been formalised.

The terms "Indie," "AA," and "AAA" originated in the early 2000s as the industry began distinguishing between different scales of production [CITATION NEEDED: industry history source on origin of these terms]. Initially useful shorthand, these labels have become increasingly inadequate as the industry has diversified. A solo developer working from their bedroom, a 30-person studio with venture capital backing, and a 15-person team bootstrapping their first commercial release might all describe themselves as "indie," despite having fundamentally different resources, constraints, and contexts.

This terminology gap creates practical problems across the industry: unfair competition in awards, unclear eligibility for grants, inconsistent media coverage, and difficulty for studios to position themselves accurately. The International Game Studio Classification (IGSC) addresses this gap by proposing a formal, multi-dimensional taxonomy built on verifiable structural criteria rather than subjective cultural labels.

---

## 2. The Problem

The game industry has no standard system for classifying studios or projects. The labels we use, Indie, AA, and AAA, emerged informally and mean different things to different people.

This absence of structure creates real problems:

- **Studios** cannot position themselves accurately or benchmark against true peers
- **Awards and showcases** pit mismatched studios against each other
- **Publishers and investors** lack meaningful segmentation for scouting
- **Grant programmes** struggle to define clear eligibility criteria
- **Press and analysts** report on segments inconsistently
- **Players** have no reliable way to understand a game's production context

The industry deserves better.

## 3. Why Current Labels Fail

### 3.1 Definitions Are Inconsistent

There is no universal agreement on what Indie, AA, or AAA mean. Different sources cite different thresholds [CITATION NEEDED: examples of conflicting definitions from industry sources, e.g., GDC talks, industry articles, publisher guidelines]:

- "Indie" might mean budget under $1M, team under 10, or simply "no publisher"
- "AA" ranges from "a few million" to "tens of millions" depending on who you ask
- "AAA" is vaguely "big budget, big team, big publisher" without clear boundaries

The same studio could be classified differently depending on which criteria you prioritise.

### 3.2 Labels Conflate Multiple Dimensions

Current classifications muddle together distinct variables:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Budget | How much money is spent |
| Team size | Number of developers |
| Funding source | Self-funded vs publisher-backed |
| Creative independence | Who controls creative decisions |
| Production values | Visual fidelity, scope, polish |
| Distribution | Digital-only vs retail presence |

A single label cannot meaningfully capture all of these. A 40-person studio with publisher funding is fundamentally different from a solo developer, yet both might call themselves "indie."

### 3.3 Wildly Different Studios Get Lumped Together

The current system creates absurd groupings:

- A one-person hobbyist and a 40-person funded studio both labelled "indie"
- A $5M project and a $25M project both called "AA"
- Studios with radically different resources competing in the same category

### 3.4 Unfair Competition

Without clear classification:

- Awards pit mismatched studios against each other
- "Best Indie Game" becomes meaningless when entries range from solo projects to 50-person teams [CITATION NEEDED: examples of award category controversies or discussions about indie eligibility]
- Well-funded studios labelled "indie" crowd out genuine small creators
- Backlash against "fake indies" creates identity friction [CITATION NEEDED: industry discussion on "fake indie" controversies, e.g., developer community debates]

### 3.5 No Lifecycle Tracking

Current labels are static. There is no mechanism to:

- Track how studios grow over time
- Recognise when a studio graduates from one tier to another
- Benchmark success relative to starting context
- Celebrate growth without losing credibility

---

## 4. The Framework

The IGSC addresses these failures through a **two-layer, multi-dimensional approach**.

Rather than a single fuzzy label, studios are classified across:

1. **Structural Classification**: what resources the studio has while building
2. **Outcome Classification**: what results they achieve after release

This creates a matrix that captures both context and performance, enabling fair comparison and meaningful benchmarking.

### Core Principles

> **Classification must be voluntary, verifiable, and based on proxy metrics rather than confidential financial disclosure.**

Studios should not need to reveal exact funding or revenue. Classification relies on safe, non-sensitive bands and transparent structural variables.

> **Classification must be prospective, not just retrospective.**

Unlike systems that classify games after release based on output metrics, IGSC classifies studios at any stage: before development begins, during production, or after release. This enables practical use cases that retrospective systems cannot support: grant eligibility determination, award category placement, publisher scouting, and studio self-positioning. A studio can be classified on day one, not just after shipping.

## 5. Classification Dimensions

### 5.1 Structural Classification (Production Context)

Structural classification focuses on what resources the studio has while building. These variables are relatively stable and define the production context.

| Variable | Description | Example Brackets |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Team Size** | Number of people working on the project | 1–5 / 6–20 / 21–80 / 80+ |
| **Ownership** | Studio's relationship to publishers/platforms | Independent / Affiliated / Owned |
| **Funding Source** | Where money comes from (not amounts) | Self-funded / Grant / Publisher / Investor |
| **External Support** | Use of outsourcing, co-dev, marketing partners | None / Limited / Significant |
| **Production Scope** | Ambition and scale of the project | Small / Medium / Large / Massive |

### 5.2 Outcome Classification (Success Metrics)

Outcome classification reflects performance after a game is launched. This enables reclassification over time, creating a lifecycle rather than a static identity.

| Variable | Description | Example Bands |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Revenue** | Commercial performance | R0: <$100K / R1: $100K–$1M / R2: $1M–$10M / R3: $10M–$50M / R4: $50M+ |
| **Player Base** | Audience reached | CCU, DAU, or units sold brackets |
| **Critical Reception** | Quality recognition | Review score bands |
| **Growth Signals** | Trajectory indicators | Hiring expansion / follow-up funding / sequel greenlit |

---

## 6. Tier Definitions

### 6.1 Team Size Tiers

| Tier | Team Size | Typical Characteristics |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Micro** | 1–5 | Solo developers, small partnerships, hobbyist-origin studios |
| **Small** | 6–20 | Established small studios, often genre-focused |
| **Mid** | 21–80 | Multiple concurrent projects, departmental structure |
| **Large** | 80+ | Full production capabilities, significant infrastructure |

### 6.2 Ownership Types

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Independent** | Fully independent; no major publisher or platform controls decisions |
| **Affiliated** | Independent studio with significant publisher funding, support, or partnership |
| **Owned** | Studio owned by a platform holder or major publisher |

### 6.3 Production Scope

| Scope | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| **Small** | Limited systems, short playtime, focused mechanics |
| **Medium** | Multiple systems, moderate playtime, some polish investment |
| **Large** | Complex systems, significant playtime, high production values |
| **Massive** | Industry-leading scope, multi-year development, AAA-level investment |

### 6.4 Combined Classification Examples

Studios are classified by combining dimensions:

| Example | IGSC Classification |
|---------|---------------------|
| Solo developer, self-funded, small scope | Micro / Independent / Small |
| 15-person studio with publisher deal, medium scope | Small / Affiliated / Medium |
| 50-person studio, investor-backed, large scope | Mid / Affiliated / Large |
| Platform-owned studio, 200+ team, massive scope | Large / Owned / Massive |

This replaces vague labels with precise, comparable classifications.

## 7. How Classification Works

### 7.1 Self-Classification Process

1. **Studio completes a classification form** with basic information:
   - Team size (headcount bracket)
   - Ownership structure
   - Primary funding source(s)
   - External support used
   - Production scope of current/recent project

2. **System assigns classification** based on responses:
   - No sensitive financial disclosure required
   - All inputs are bracketed ranges, not exact figures
   - Process takes under 5 minutes

3. **Studio receives classification badge/certificate**:
   - Digital badge for press kits, websites, social media
   - Verification ID for authenticity
   - Listed in public registry (optional)

4. **Annual update or milestone reclassification**:
   - Studios update classification yearly or after major changes
   - Growth is tracked and celebrated
   - Historical classifications preserved for context

### 7.2 What Studios Provide

| Required | Optional |
|----------|----------|
| Team size bracket | Company website |
| Ownership type | Recent project(s) |
| Primary funding source | Links to store pages |
| Production scope | Press kit |

### 7.3 What Studios Do NOT Provide

- Exact revenue figures
- Detailed financial statements
- Confidential business information
- Investor or publisher names (unless public)

---

## 8. Use Cases

### 8.1 Awards and Showcases

**Problem:** "Best Indie Game" categories pit solo developers against 40-person funded studios.

**Solution:** Create award categories by IGSC tier:
- Best Micro Studio Game
- Best Small Studio Game
- Best Mid Studio Game

Fair competition within peer groups.

### 8.2 Publisher and Investor Scouting

**Problem:** Difficult to segment and scout studios meaningfully.

**Solution:** Filter and search by IGSC classification:
- "Show me Independent / Small studios with R2+ outcomes"
- "Find Affiliated / Mid studios in [genre]"

Structured discovery.

### 8.3 Grant Programmes and Funding

**Problem:** Unclear eligibility; mismatched applicants.

**Solution:** Define eligibility by IGSC classification:
- "This grant is for IGSC Micro and Small / Independent studios only"
- Clear criteria, less ambiguity.

### 8.4 Industry Analysis and Reporting

**Problem:** Inconsistent segment definitions across reports.

**Solution:** Standardised IGSC classification enables:
- Comparable data across sources
- Trend analysis by tier
- Meaningful benchmarking

### 8.5 Studio Self-Understanding

**Problem:** Studios unsure how to position themselves.

**Solution:** IGSC classification provides:
- Honest self-assessment
- Benchmark against true peers
- Track growth over time
- Credible positioning for partners

## 9. Supporting Research & Comparative Analysis

This section examines existing approaches to studio and project classification within gaming and adjacent creative industries, providing context for the IGSC framework's design decisions.

### 9.1 Industry Context

The game industry's lack of standardised classification stands in contrast to other creative sectors:

**Film Industry:** Motion pictures are classified by budget tiers (micro-budget, low-budget, mid-budget, tentpole) with generally accepted thresholds [CITATION NEEDED: film industry budget classification source]. The Motion Picture Association provides content ratings, while production context is communicated through distributor relationships and marketing positioning.

**Music Industry:** The distinction between major labels, independent labels, and self-released artists is well-established, with trade organisations like IMPALA (Independent Music Companies Association) providing formal definitions for "independent" status [CITATION NEEDED: IMPALA or similar trade body definition].

**Publishing Industry:** Book publishing distinguishes between the "Big Five" (formerly Big Six) publishers, mid-size houses, small presses, and self-publishing, with clear structural differences understood across the industry [CITATION NEEDED: publishing industry structure source].

### 9.2 Existing Game Industry Approaches

Several organisations have attempted partial solutions to classification:

**Platform-Specific Programmes:** Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo each maintain their own developer programmes with internal tiers, though these classifications are proprietary and inconsistent across platforms [CITATION NEEDED: examples of platform developer programmes and their tier structures].

**Trade Organisations:** Bodies such as IGDA (International Game Developers Association) and regional equivalents provide community support but have not established formal classification standards [CITATION NEEDED: IGDA or similar organisation's approach to studio definitions].

**Awards Bodies:** The Game Awards, BAFTA Games, and similar organisations have experimented with categories like "Best Independent Game" but apply inconsistent eligibility criteria [CITATION NEEDED: comparison of major awards' indie game eligibility criteria].

**Market Research Firms:** Newzoo, Sensor Tower, and similar analysts use varying definitions when segmenting the market by studio size [CITATION NEEDED: examples of market research firm definitions for indie/AA/AAA].

### 9.3 Academic and Industry Research

Limited formal research exists on game studio classification:

- Studies on indie game development have noted definitional inconsistency as a barrier to meaningful analysis [CITATION NEEDED: academic study on indie game definitions]
- GDC State of the Industry surveys collect data on studio size but do not propose standardised classification [CITATION NEEDED: GDC survey methodology]
- Industry commentary frequently highlights the "indie identity" debate without proposing structural solutions [CITATION NEEDED: games journalism on indie definition debates, e.g., GamesIndustry.biz, Gamasutra/GameDeveloper articles]

### 9.4 The HushCrasher Classification System (HCS)

The most significant recent attempt at game classification is the HushCrasher Classification System (HCS 1.0), developed by Antoine Mayerowitz and Julie Belzanne and published in 2024-2025 (Mayerowitz & Belzanne, 2025).

**Methodology:** HCS uses machine learning clustering on Steam data since 2006, enhanced with Mobygames credits data. The system classifies games based on two primary metrics:
- Credits length (number of people credited, excluding QA and special thanks)
- Disk size (game file size in MB/GB)

**Categories:** HCS proposes four tiers: Kei (solo/tiny teams), Midi (small-medium studios), AA, and AAA.

**Key Findings:** HCS analysis revealed that small-scale games ("Kei") now represent 75% of 2024 releases, a 16-fold increase since 2017. Despite this market flooding, these games maintain a stable ~25% revenue share. Median per-game revenue collapsed 97% between 2012-2018.

**Limitations for Studio Classification:** While HCS provides valuable market analysis, it addresses a different problem than IGSC:

| Dimension | HCS | IGSC |
|-----------|-----|------|
| **Classifies** | Games (products) | Studios (entities) |
| **Timing** | Retrospective (post-release only) | Prospective (any development stage) |
| **Primary metrics** | Credits + file size | Team size, funding, ownership, control |
| **Funding visibility** | None | Source and general scale |
| **Creative control** | Not considered | Core dimension |
| **Self-classification** | No (data-derived) | Yes (voluntary) |

HCS cannot classify a studio before release, cannot distinguish between a bootstrapped solo developer and one with $2M in venture funding, and introduces new terminology (Kei, Midi) that may face adoption resistance.

**Complementary Approaches:** IGSC and HCS solve different problems and could coexist. IGSC classifies the studio's structural context; HCS classifies the output's production scope. A studio classified as Indie-Minor by IGSC might produce a Midi-scale game by HCS metrics, indicating they punched above their weight.

### 9.5 Why Existing Approaches Fall Short

Current approaches share common limitations:

| Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Platform programmes | Proprietary, platform-specific, not transferable |
| Trade organisations | Community-focused, not classification-focused |
| Awards bodies | Ad-hoc definitions, inconsistent year-to-year |
| Market research | Internal methodologies, not publicly standardised |

The IGSC addresses these gaps by providing an open, platform-agnostic, multi-dimensional framework with transparent criteria.

## 10. Design Principles

The IGSC is built on these non-negotiable principles:

### 10.1 Voluntary Participation

Classification is opt-in. Studios choose to participate and can withdraw at any time. No studio is classified without their consent.

### 10.2 No Sensitive Disclosure

Studios never need to reveal exact funding, revenue, or confidential business information. All inputs use safe, bracketed ranges.

### 10.3 Transparent Criteria

The classification methodology is fully public. Any studio can understand exactly how they would be classified before participating.

### 10.4 Neutral Language

Tiers are descriptive, not hierarchical. "Micro" is not inferior to "Large"; they are different contexts. The framework avoids value judgements.

### 10.5 Lifecycle Awareness

Classification is not permanent. Studios grow, circumstances change. The IGSC supports reclassification and tracks evolution over time.

### 10.6 Global Applicability

The framework works across regions, accounting for cost variations. A 10-person studio in Eastern Europe and a 10-person studio in San Francisco are both "Small"; budget thresholds are secondary to structural reality.

---

## 11. Governance & Evolution

### 11.1 How Standards Gain Authority

Standards are not granted authority; they earn it through adoption. The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) did not begin with legal authority. It was created by the industry to self-regulate, and became authoritative because retailers and platform holders *chose* to require it. Similarly, PEGI (Pan European Game Information) became the de facto European standard not through legislation, but through voluntary adoption by industry stakeholders who found it useful.

IGSC follows this model. The framework becomes valuable when studios classify themselves, when awards bodies use IGSC tiers for categories, when grant programmes reference IGSC for eligibility, and when publishers filter by IGSC classification. Each adoption makes the next one easier, creating network effects that compound over time.

### 11.2 Current Governance

The IGSC is maintained by its creator as an open standard. The framework documentation is publicly available, and feedback is welcomed.

### 11.3 Evolution Process

The framework will evolve as the industry changes:

- **Annual review** of tier thresholds and definitions
- **Community feedback** incorporated into updates
- **Version control** with clear changelogs
- **Backward compatibility** considered for existing classifications

### 11.4 Future Governance Options

As adoption grows, governance may evolve to include:

- Advisory board with industry representation
- Formal standards body (if warranted)
- Community-driven governance model

The priority is adoption first, formalised governance second.
