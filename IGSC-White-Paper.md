## Executive Summary

The video game industry relies on informal labels — Indie, AA, AAA — to classify studios and projects. These terms are culturally defined rather than structurally defined, leading to inconsistency, unfair competition, and a lack of transparency.

The **International Game Studio Classification (IGSC)** proposes a formal, multi-dimensional taxonomy that classifies studios based on clear, verifiable criteria across two axes: **Structural Context** (what resources a studio has) and **Outcome Metrics** (what results they achieve). The framework is:

- **Voluntary** — studios self-classify
- **Transparent** — criteria are public and consistent
- **Non-invasive** — no sensitive financial disclosure required
- **Lifecycle-aware** — studios can reclassify as they grow

This white paper outlines the problem, presents the framework, and invites adoption by platforms, awards bodies, publishers, and the broader industry.

## 1. The Problem

The game industry has no standard system for classifying studios or projects. The labels we use — Indie, AA, AAA — emerged informally and mean different things to different people.

This absence of structure creates real problems:

- **Studios** cannot position themselves accurately or benchmark against true peers
- **Awards and showcases** pit mismatched studios against each other
- **Publishers and investors** lack meaningful segmentation for scouting
- **Grant programmes** struggle to define clear eligibility criteria
- **Press and analysts** report on segments inconsistently
- **Players** have no reliable way to understand a game's production context

The industry deserves better.

## 2. Why Current Labels Fail

### 2.1 Definitions Are Inconsistent

There is no universal agreement on what Indie, AA, or AAA mean. Different sources cite different thresholds:

- "Indie" might mean budget under $1M, team under 10, or simply "no publisher"
- "AA" ranges from "a few million" to "tens of millions" depending on who you ask
- "AAA" is vaguely "big budget, big team, big publisher" without clear boundaries

The same studio could be classified differently depending on which criteria you prioritise.

### 2.2 Labels Conflate Multiple Dimensions

Current classifications muddle together distinct variables:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Budget | How much money is spent |
| Team size | Number of developers |
| Funding source | Self-funded vs publisher-backed |
| Creative independence | Who controls creative decisions |
| Production values | Visual fidelity, scope, polish |
| Distribution | Digital-only vs retail presence |

A single label cannot meaningfully capture all of these. A 40-person studio with publisher funding is fundamentally different from a solo developer, yet both might call themselves "indie."

### 2.3 Wildly Different Studios Get Lumped Together

The current system creates absurd groupings:

- A one-person hobbyist and a 40-person funded studio both labelled "indie"
- A $5M project and a $25M project both called "AA"
- Studios with radically different resources competing in the same category

### 2.4 Unfair Competition

Without clear classification:

- Awards pit mismatched studios against each other
- "Best Indie Game" becomes meaningless when entries range from solo projects to 50-person teams
- Well-funded studios labelled "indie" crowd out genuine small creators
- Backlash against "fake indies" creates identity friction

### 2.5 No Lifecycle Tracking

Current labels are static. There is no mechanism to:

- Track how studios grow over time
- Recognise when a studio graduates from one tier to another
- Benchmark success relative to starting context
- Celebrate growth without losing credibility

---

## 3. The Framework

The IGSC addresses these failures through a **two-layer, multi-dimensional approach**.

Rather than a single fuzzy label, studios are classified across:

1. **Structural Classification** — what resources the studio has while building
2. **Outcome Classification** — what results they achieve after release

This creates a matrix that captures both context and performance, enabling fair comparison and meaningful benchmarking.

### Core Principle

> **Classification must be voluntary, verifiable, and based on proxy metrics rather than confidential financial disclosure.**

Studios should not need to reveal exact funding or revenue. Classification relies on safe, non-sensitive bands and transparent structural variables.

---

## 4. Classification Dimensions

### 4.1 Structural Classification (Production Context)

Structural classification focuses on what resources the studio has while building. These variables are relatively stable and define the production context.

| Variable | Description | Example Brackets |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Team Size** | Number of people working on the project | 1–5 / 6–20 / 21–80 / 80+ |
| **Ownership** | Studio's relationship to publishers/platforms | Independent / Affiliated / Owned |
| **Funding Source** | Where money comes from (not amounts) | Self-funded / Grant / Publisher / Investor |
| **External Support** | Use of outsourcing, co-dev, marketing partners | None / Limited / Significant |
| **Production Scope** | Ambition and scale of the project | Small / Medium / Large / Massive |

### 4.2 Outcome Classification (Success Metrics)

Outcome classification reflects performance after a game is launched. This enables reclassification over time — a lifecycle rather than a static identity.

| Variable | Description | Example Bands |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Revenue** | Commercial performance | R0: <$100K / R1: $100K–$1M / R2: $1M–$10M / R3: $10M–$50M / R4: $50M+ |
| **Player Base** | Audience reached | CCU, DAU, or units sold brackets |
| **Critical Reception** | Quality recognition | Review score bands |
| **Growth Signals** | Trajectory indicators | Hiring expansion / follow-up funding / sequel greenlit |

## 5. Tier Definitions

### 5.1 Team Size Tiers

| Tier | Team Size | Typical Characteristics |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Micro** | 1–5 | Solo developers, small partnerships, hobbyist-origin studios |
| **Small** | 6–20 | Established small studios, often genre-focused |
| **Mid** | 21–80 | Multiple concurrent projects, departmental structure |
| **Large** | 80+ | Full production capabilities, significant infrastructure |

### 5.2 Ownership Types

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Independent** | Fully independent; no major publisher or platform controls decisions |
| **Affiliated** | Independent studio with significant publisher funding, support, or partnership |
| **Owned** | Studio owned by a platform holder or major publisher |

### 5.3 Production Scope

| Scope | Indicators |
|-------|------------|
| **Small** | Limited systems, short playtime, focused mechanics |
| **Medium** | Multiple systems, moderate playtime, some polish investment |
| **Large** | Complex systems, significant playtime, high production values |
| **Massive** | Industry-leading scope, multi-year development, AAA-level investment |

### 5.4 Combined Classification Examples

Studios are classified by combining dimensions:

| Example | IGSC Classification |
|---------|---------------------|
| Solo developer, self-funded, small scope | Micro / Independent / Small |
| 15-person studio with publisher deal, medium scope | Small / Affiliated / Medium |
| 50-person studio, investor-backed, large scope | Mid / Affiliated / Large |
| Platform-owned studio, 200+ team, massive scope | Large / Owned / Massive |

This replaces vague labels with precise, comparable classifications.

## 6. How Classification Works

### 6.1 Self-Classification Process

1. **Studio completes a classification form** with basic information:
   - Team size (headcount bracket)
   - Ownership structure
   - Primary funding source(s)
   - External support used
   - Production scope of current/recent project

2. **System assigns classification** based on responses:
   - No sensitive financial disclosure required
   - All inputs are bracketed ranges, not exact figures
   - Process takes under 5 minutes

3. **Studio receives classification badge/certificate**:
   - Digital badge for press kits, websites, social media
   - Verification ID for authenticity
   - Listed in public registry (optional)

4. **Annual update or milestone reclassification**:
   - Studios update classification yearly or after major changes
   - Growth is tracked and celebrated
   - Historical classifications preserved for context

### 6.2 What Studios Provide

| Required | Optional |
|----------|----------|
| Team size bracket | Company website |
| Ownership type | Recent project(s) |
| Primary funding source | Links to store pages |
| Production scope | Press kit |

### 6.3 What Studios Do NOT Provide

- Exact revenue figures
- Detailed financial statements
- Confidential business information
- Investor or publisher names (unless public)

---

## 7. Use Cases

### 7.1 Awards and Showcases

**Problem:** "Best Indie Game" categories pit solo developers against 40-person funded studios.

**Solution:** Create award categories by IGSC tier:
- Best Micro Studio Game
- Best Small Studio Game
- Best Mid Studio Game

Fair competition within peer groups.

### 7.2 Publisher and Investor Scouting

**Problem:** Difficult to segment and scout studios meaningfully.

**Solution:** Filter and search by IGSC classification:
- "Show me Independent / Small studios with R2+ outcomes"
- "Find Affiliated / Mid studios in [genre]"

Structured discovery.

### 7.3 Grant Programmes and Funding

**Problem:** Unclear eligibility; mismatched applicants.

**Solution:** Define eligibility by IGSC classification:
- "This grant is for IGSC Micro and Small / Independent studios only"
- Clear criteria, less ambiguity.

### 7.4 Industry Analysis and Reporting

**Problem:** Inconsistent segment definitions across reports.

**Solution:** Standardised IGSC classification enables:
- Comparable data across sources
- Trend analysis by tier
- Meaningful benchmarking

### 7.5 Studio Self-Understanding

**Problem:** Studios unsure how to position themselves.

**Solution:** IGSC classification provides:
- Honest self-assessment
- Benchmark against true peers
- Track growth over time
- Credible positioning for partners

## 8. Design Principles

The IGSC is built on these non-negotiable principles:

### 8.1 Voluntary Participation

Classification is opt-in. Studios choose to participate and can withdraw at any time. No studio is classified without their consent.

### 8.2 No Sensitive Disclosure

Studios never need to reveal exact funding, revenue, or confidential business information. All inputs use safe, bracketed ranges.

### 8.3 Transparent Criteria

The classification methodology is fully public. Any studio can understand exactly how they would be classified before participating.

### 8.4 Neutral Language

Tiers are descriptive, not hierarchical. "Micro" is not inferior to "Large" — they are different contexts. The framework avoids value judgements.

### 8.5 Lifecycle Awareness

Classification is not permanent. Studios grow, circumstances change. The IGSC supports reclassification and tracks evolution over time.

### 8.6 Global Applicability

The framework works across regions, accounting for cost variations. A 10-person studio in Eastern Europe and a 10-person studio in San Francisco are both "Small" — budget thresholds are secondary to structural reality.

---

## 9. Governance & Evolution

### 9.1 Current Governance

The IGSC is maintained by its creator as an open standard. The framework documentation is publicly available, and feedback is welcomed.

### 9.2 Evolution Process

The framework will evolve as the industry changes:

- **Annual review** of tier thresholds and definitions
- **Community feedback** incorporated into updates
- **Version control** with clear changelogs
- **Backward compatibility** considered for existing classifications

### 9.3 Future Governance Options

As adoption grows, governance may evolve to include:

- Advisory board with industry representation
- Formal standards body (if warranted)
- Community-driven governance model

The priority is adoption first, formalised governance second.
