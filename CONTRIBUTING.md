# Contributing to IGSC

Thank you for your interest in the International Game Studio Classification (IGSC).

## How to Contribute

### Feedback & Suggestions

The best way to contribute is through GitHub Issues:

1. **Bug reports** — If you find inconsistencies or errors in the specification
2. **Clarification requests** — If something is unclear or ambiguous
3. **Enhancement suggestions** — Ideas for improving the framework
4. **Edge cases** — Studios or scenarios that don't fit cleanly into current tiers

Please search existing issues before creating a new one.

### Discussion

For broader discussions about the framework's direction, use GitHub Discussions (if enabled) or open an issue tagged `[Discussion]`.

### Pull Requests

For direct contributions to the specification:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages
4. Submit a pull request with a description of the change and rationale

**Note:** Significant changes to the classification criteria will be carefully reviewed to ensure backward compatibility and consistency.

## What We're Looking For

- Real-world edge cases that test the framework
- Regional considerations (cost variations, market differences)
- Clarity improvements to tier definitions
- Use case examples from different stakeholders

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the framework, not individuals
- Assume good faith in discussions

## Adoption Enquiries

If you're interested in adopting IGSC for your organisation (awards, platform, publisher, etc.), please open an issue tagged `[Adoption]` or contact the author directly.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same [CC BY 4.0 license](LICENSE) as the rest of the project.
